## ðŸš€ Gradual Implementation Strategy

### Stage 1: Foundation Building (Week 1) - Impact: Minimal

#### 1.1 Create Directory Structure
```bash
# Basic Memory Bank structure
mkdir -p .claude/core
mkdir -p .claude/context
mkdir -p .claude/scripts
mkdir -p docs

# Add gradually (later)
# mkdir -p .claude/debug
# mkdir -p .claude/commands
# mkdir -p docs/adr
```

#### 1.2 Introduce Minimal Configuration Files
```bash
# Cache settings + security settings (immediate effect)
cat > .claude/settings.json << 'EOF'
{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CACHE": "./.ccache"
  },
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": ".claude/scripts/deny-check.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
EOF

# Update .gitignore
echo ".ccache/" >> .gitignore
echo "*.cache" >> .gitignore
```

#### 1.2.1 Security Feature Implementation
```bash
# Install security scripts (copy from template)
# Place deny-check.sh, allow-check.sh, test-security.sh
chmod +x .claude/scripts/*.sh

# Run security tests
.claude/scripts/test-security.sh
```

#### 1.2.2 AI Logger Feature Implementation (Recommended)
```bash
# Install AI Logger scripts (copy from template)
# Place ai-logger.sh, analyze-ai-logs.py, ai-logger-README.md
chmod +x .claude/scripts/ai-logger.sh
chmod +x .claude/scripts/analyze-ai-logs.py

# Add AI Logger to settings.json
# Add the following to PostToolUse section:
# {
#   "type": "command",
#   "command": ".claude/scripts/ai-logger.sh"
# }

# Verify operation
echo "test" > test.txt && rm test.txt
ls -la ~/.claude/ai-activity.jsonl
```

**AI Logger Benefits**:
- AI effectively analyzes errors with structured logs
- Automatic collection of project and environment information
- Parallel operation with existing log systems
- Reference: [Vibe Logger](https://github.com/fladdict/vibe-logger)

#### 1.3 Create Current State Snapshot
```markdown
# .claude/core/overview.md
---
cache_control: {"type": "ephemeral"}
---

---
cache_control: {"type": "ephemeral"}
---
# Technical Details

## Current Technology Stack
[Technical information extracted from existing system]

## Development Environment
[Setup procedures collected from existing sources]

## Operation Information
[Deployment and monitoring methods]
```

#### 2.3 Start Recording History and Background
```markdown
# .claude/context/history.md
# Project History

## Important Decisions (Retroactive Recording)
### [Date] [Title]
- **Background**: [To the extent possible]
- **Decision**: [Inferred from current situation]
- **Impact**: [Impact on present]

*Incomplete information will be supplemented with future decisions
```

#### Expected Benefits
- **Information consolidation**: Centralization of scattered information
- **Visualization**: Clarification of overall project picture

### Stage 3: Operation Establishment (Week 4-6) - Impact: Medium

#### 3.1 Integration into Daily Workflow
```markdown
# .claude/core/current.md
# Current Status

## This Week's Focus
- [Priority 1] [Task name]
- [Priority 2] [Task name]

## Ongoing Issues
- **[Issue name]**: [Status] - [Next action]

*Make weekly updates a habit
```

#### 3.2 Next Action Management
```markdown
# .claude/core/next.md
# Next Actions

## Today's Tasks
1. [Specific task 1]
2. [Specific task 2]
3. [Specific task 3]

## This Week's Goal
- [Weekly goal]

*Simple daily updates
```

#### 3.3 Custom Command Introduction
```markdown
# .claude/core/templates.md
---
cache_control: {"type": "ephemeral"}
---
# Quick Templates

## Basic Patterns
### `/project:plan` - Planning
[Project-specific planning template]

### `/project:daily` - Daily Update
[Simple format for current.md updates]
```

#### Expected Benefits
- **Habituation**: Making Memory Bank updates routine
- **Efficiency**: Simplification of routine work

### Stage 4: Advanced Feature Introduction (Week 7-8) - Impact: Medium-High

#### 4.1 ADR System Implementation
```bash
mkdir -p docs/adr
cp [template-path]/docs/adr/template.md docs/adr/
```

#### 4.2 Start Technical Debt Management
```markdown
# .claude/context/debt.md
---
cache_control: {"type": "ephemeral"}
---
# Technical Debt Tracking

## Currently Recognized Debt
[Systematize existing "things that somewhat concern me"]

### High Priority ðŸ”¥
| Debt Content | Estimated Cost | Impact Range |
|--------------|----------------|--------------|
| [Specific problem] | [Time] | [Range] |
```

#### 4.3 Deployment to Entire Team
- Memory Bank utilization sharing session (30 minutes)
- Clarification of update rules and responsibilities
- Establishment of continuous improvement cycle

---

## ðŸ‘¥ Team Implementation Strategy

### Resistance Minimization Approach

#### Gradual Member Involvement
1. **Week 1-2**: Foundation building by main person only
2. **Week 3-4**: Share with core developers (2-3 people) for feedback
3. **Week 5-6**: Deployment to entire team
4. **Week 7-8**: Operation establishment and rule creation

#### Value Realization Presentation
- **Immediate value**: Share cost reduction from cache effect numerically
- **Information value**: Immediate answers to "What was that thing?"
- **Efficiency value**: Reduced new member onboarding time

### Continuous Improvement Cycle

#### Weekly Review (10 minutes)
- Check Memory Bank usage status
- Collect inconveniences and improvement points
- Decide next week's improvement actions

#### Monthly Optimization (30 minutes)
- Archive low-frequency files
- Add new templates and patterns
- Team-specific customization

## âš¡ Common Issues and Solutions

### Early Implementation Issues

**Q: "I don't know what to write"**
A: Start by writing the current state without seeking perfection. List "current problems" and "frequently asked questions" in bullet points

**Q: "Updates don't continue"**
A: Set up weekly 5-minute "Memory Bank update time". Focus on continuation rather than perfection

**Q: "Team members don't use it"**
A: Experiencing "convenience" is important. Share specific value experiences (immediate answers, cost reduction)

### Operational Issues

**Q: "Information becomes outdated"**
A: Separate cache_control applied files (long-term stable) from frequently updated files. Set regular reviews

**Q: "Memory Bank becomes bloated"**
A: Set archive rules. Move to archive/ after "3 months without reference"

**Q: "It became a formality"**
A: Reconfirm usage value. Continuous introduction of new features and improvements
