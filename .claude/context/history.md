## Resolved Problems
### 2025-07-21 Mobile UX Responsive Integration Challenge
- **Problem**: Complex mobile/desktop conditional rendering with duplicate component text causing test failures
- **Cause**: TabArea and MobileAccordion both displaying "üìù „Éá„Ç§„É™„Éº„É°„É¢" button simultaneously in tests
- **Solution**: Conditional rendering with `{!isMobile && TabArea}` and `{isMobile && MobileAccordion}` + specific test selectors
- **Learning**: Always implement mobile/desktop conditional rendering at component level, not just styling level

### 2025-07-21 matchMedia Test Mocking Complexity
- **Problem**: Complex matchMedia mocking required for responsive behavior testing
- **Cause**: Multiple components requiring different matchMedia responses (768px boundary)
- **Solution**: Helper functions `setupMobileEnvironment()` and `setupDesktopEnvironment()` for consistent test setup
- **Learning**: Abstract complex test setup into reusable helper functions for better maintainability
