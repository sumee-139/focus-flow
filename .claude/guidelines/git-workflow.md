### Pull Request Conventions

  - **Changes**: What was changed (high level)
  - **Impact**: Where it affects
  - **Testing**: How it was tested

### Review

- Prohibition of tool mentions like `Co-authored-by`

## ADR (Architecture Decision Record)

### Basic Operations

- **Create New ADR**: Generate template with `claude adr new "decision content"`
- **Numbering**: Manage with ADR-001, ADR-002...
- **Status**: Proposed → Accepted → Deprecated/Superseded

### Decisions to Record
- Technology stack selection (frameworks, libraries, etc.)
- Architecture design (database, API design, etc.)
- Security policies (authentication, encryption, etc.)
- Performance optimization techniques
- Deployment strategies

### Integration Systems
- **Debt Log**: Track technical impact in @.claude/context/debt.md
- **History Management**: Record decision history in @.claude/context/history.md
- **GitHub Integration**: Create PRs linked with Issue numbers
