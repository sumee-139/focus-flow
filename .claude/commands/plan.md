# Work Planning

To create an efficient plan, load the Memory Bank progressively and develop a work plan.

## Execution Steps

1. **Core Information Analysis**
   - Load `@.claude/core/current.md` and `@.claude/core/next.md`
   - Understand current situation and immediate tasks
   - Evaluate urgency and importance

2. **Detailed Analysis (As Needed)**
   - Check overall project with `@.claude/core/overview.md`
   - Reference `@.claude/context/tech.md` only when technical details are needed
   - Reference `@.claude/context/history.md` only when past context is important

3. **Create Priority Matrix**
   - Classify tasks using Urgent × Important quadrants
   - Determine implementation order considering dependencies
   - Consider resources (time and focus)

4. **Create Practical Plan**
   - Classify tasks into Today/This Week/Next Week
   - Estimate time for each task (15-minute increments)
   - Clear completion criteria (Definition of Done)

5. **Risk Assessment**
   - Identify potential blockers
   - Prepare contingency plans (Plan B)

6. **Record the Plan**
   - Record today's plan in `core/next.md`
   - Record weekly plan in `core/current.md`

Keep loaded files to the minimum necessary, and reference detailed information only when explicitly requested.
