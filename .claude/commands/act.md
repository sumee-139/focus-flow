# Execute Implementation

Execute implementation work based on the developed plan.

## Execution Steps

1. **Pre-check**
   - Confirm current task from `activeContext.md`
   - Verify necessary files and directories
   - Confirm dependencies are satisfied
   - Verify current directory is at project root

2. **Implementation Work**
   - Explain design before writing code
   - Iterate implementation and testing in small units
   - Implement proper error handling

3. **Quality Check**
   - Run code linting
   - Perform basic functionality verification
   - Test error cases

4. **Documentation Update**
   - Document implemented features
   - Clearly describe usage instructions
   - Record any limitations

5. **Progress Update**
   - Update relevant items in `progress.md`
   - Mark completed tasks with ✓
   - Record newly discovered issues

6. **Commit Preparation**
   - Organize changes
   - Create clear commit messages
   - Group related files

After implementation is complete, always update `activeContext.md` and `progress.md`.
