```

### Step 4: Enable AI Logger (Optional)
```bash
# Check configuration file
cat .claude/settings.json

# Verify AI Logger is included in hooks
# Check if "command": ".claude/scripts/ai-logger.sh" exists

# Test run
echo "Test file" > test.txt
rm test.txt

# Check AI logs
ls -la ~/.claude/ai-activity.jsonl
```

### Step 5: Verification
```bash
# Check file structure
find .claude -type f -name "*.md" | sort
