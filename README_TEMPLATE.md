# Claude Code Lightweight Project Template v1.2.0

**The Next-Generation Knowledge Management System Designed for AI-Native Development**

## 🚀 Why This Template is Revolutionary

### 1. **90% Cost Reduction** - Prompt Cache Optimization
By applying `cache_control` to long-term stable information (project overview, technical specifications, etc.), this system dramatically reduces Claude API usage costs. It fundamentally solves the cost problem in daily AI-powered development.

### 2. **AI Analyzes Problems Instantly** - AI-Friendly Logger (Vibe Logger Concept)
Transforms logging from "logs for humans to read" to "logs for AI to analyze". Structured JSON logs automatically collect context information, evolving debugging from "guessing and checking" to "instant root cause analysis by AI".

### 3. **Systematized Project Memory** - Memory Bank System
Hierarchically structures and stores your project's "memory". Dramatically reduces onboarding time for new members and eliminates "what was that again?" moments. AI provides accurate answers instantly.

### 4. **Gradual Integration for Existing Projects**
No need to "change everything right now". The design allows gradual adoption of necessary features while minimizing risk.

- **Phase 2 (Week 3-4)**: TDD experience with small features
- **Phase 3 (Month 2-3)**: Full TDD application

#### 4. ADR System
- **Template**: `docs/adr/template.md`
- **Decision Records**: Technical choices, architecture, security policies, etc.
- **Integration**: GitHub Issues, debt log, history management

#### 5. Technical Debt Tracking
- **Priority Management**: High🔥/Medium⚠️/Low📝
- **Cost Estimation**: Estimate and record actual time
- **Cache Impact Analysis**: Deletion cost and optimization effect measurement

### Performance Effects
