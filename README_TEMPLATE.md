# Claude Friends Project Template v2.0.0

🌐 **[日本語版](README_TEMPLATE_ja.md)** | **English**

**AI-Powered Multi-Agent Development System - Your AI Team in a Box**

## 🚀 Why This Template is Revolutionary

### 1. **90% Cost Reduction** - Prompt Cache Optimization
By applying `cache_control` to long-term stable information (project overview, technical specifications, etc.), this system dramatically reduces Claude API usage costs. It fundamentally solves the cost problem in daily AI-powered development.

### 2. **AI Analyzes Problems Instantly** - AI-Friendly Logger (Vibe Logger Concept)
Transforms logging from "logs for humans to read" to "logs for AI to analyze". Structured JSON logs automatically collect context information, evolving debugging from "guessing and checking" to "instant root cause analysis by AI".

### 3. **Systematized Project Memory** - Memory Bank System
Hierarchically structures and stores your project's "memory". Dramatically reduces onboarding time for new members and eliminates "what was that again?" moments. AI provides accurate answers instantly.

### 4. **Gradual Integration for Existing Projects**
No need to "change everything right now". The design allows gradual adoption of necessary features while minimizing risk.

## 🚀 Usage

### 1. Starting a Project
```bash
# Copy the template
cp -r claude_file_template/ your-project/
cd your-project/

# Customize project information
# - Replace [Project Name] in CLAUDE.md
# - Fill in docs/requirements.md
# - Update files in .claude/core/
```

### 2. Daily Development Flow

#### With Claude Friends (Recommended)
```
Morning: /agent:planner    # Plan today's work and design features
         ↓
         "I want to add user authentication"
         → Planner automatically creates detailed specs with diagrams
         ↓
Work:    /agent:builder    # Start implementation based on plan
         ↓
         Error occurs? → Builder automatically enters Debug Mode
         Implementation done? → Builder can switch to Review Mode
         ↓
Focus:   /project:focus    # When you need to concentrate
         ↓
Evening: /project:daily    # Daily retrospective (3 min)
```

#### Tag Search (As needed)
```
Tag search: #urgent #bug #feature #completed  # Fast search for related info
```
